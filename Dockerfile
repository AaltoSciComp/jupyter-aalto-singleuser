# In the Jupyter image, the default start command is
# start-notebook.sh.  If the env var JPY_API_TOKEN is defined, it will
# thun run start-singleuser.sh which then starts the single-user
# server properly.  It starts the singleuser server by calling
# start.sh with the right arguments.  If start.sh runs as root, it
# will use some env vars like NB_USER, NB_UID, NB_GID,
# GRANT_SUDO[=yes] to do various manipulations inside to set
# permissions to this particular user before running sudo to NB_USER
# to start the single-user image.  So thus, we need to do our initial
# setup and then call this.

# Note: put hooks in /usr/local/bin/start-notebook.d/ and start.sh
# will run these (source if end in .sh, run if +x).

#CMD " && start-notebook.sh"
